<font face="AR CENA" color="white" size="6">CORROSION:-<br>
<ul>
<li>Corrosion is defined as the slow and steady destruction of a metal by the environment.</li>
<li>It results in the deterioration of the metal to form metal compounds by means of chemical reactions with the environment.</li>
</ul> <BR>
EXAMPLE:-<BR>
<UL>
<LI>Rusting of iron requires air and water.Iron articles are shiny when new, but get coated with a reddish brown powder called rust(Fe2O3.nH2O) when left for some time. This process is commonly known as rusting of iron.</LI>
<LI>The black coating on silver</LI>
<LI> the green coating on copper are other examples of corrosion</LI>
</UL>
PREVENTION:-<BR>
<UL>
<LI> By coating with paints:- Paint coated metal surfaces keep out air and moisture.</LI>
<LI> By coating with oil and grease:- Application of oil and grease on the surface of iron tools prevents them from moisture and air.</LI>
<LI> By alloying with other metals:- Alloyed metal is more resistant to corrosion. Example: stainless steel.</LI>
<LI>By the process of galvanization:- This is a process of coating zinc on iron sheets by using electric current. In this zinc forms a protective layer of zinc carbonate on the surface of iron.This prevents corrosion.</LI>
<LI>Electroplating:- It is a method of coating one metal with another by passing electric current.<BR>
Example: silver plating, nickel plating. This method not only lends protection but also enhances the metallic appearance.
